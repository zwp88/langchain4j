But the user's request is a single transfer. However, the available agents don't have a transfer function. Therefore, the correct approach is to first withdraw from Mario and then credit to Georgios. \n\nSo the first agent to invoke is the withdraw agent with user Mario and amount 100. Then, the credit agent with user Georgios and amount 100. But the user's request is to transfer, so the planner must split into two steps. Therefore, the first step is to call the withdraw agent for Mario's account. Then, the credit agent for Georgios. \n\nBut the user's request is to transfer 100 from Mario to Georgios.
